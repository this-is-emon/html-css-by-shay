Hello, amar sona pakhi.
We are going to start our journey of real software developing.
As I have invited you to colaborate in this repositroy, in which we will complete shay's tutorial.
You have to do all the necessary things he has done in lesson 1.
And commit it in the "lesson-01" branch.
I will then review it and merge it to the main branch of the repository.
